With Wi-Fi it\\'s around 7mA with spikes every few seconds.\\n\\nWith the screen on, you get 45mA with spikes up to 65mA.  Probably room to improve that.

       " 'I think every intermediate Python programmer has had to learn the gotcha that you can\\'t really duck-type iterables, because if you accidentally iterate over a string, Python will chug along perfectly fine despite it almost certainly not being the intended behavior. Even worse, because of the way collections ABCs are defined, a typing check like `isinstance(\"a string\", collections.abc.Collection)` will still return True despite it almost certainly not being what is intended.\\n\\nMy question is whether anyone knows *the history* of why this is the case. Given the direction that the language was moving in, I would\\'ve thought it\\'d be a prime candidate for removal in the 2-to-3 transition. Obviously, there are use cases for iterating along elements of a string, but with Python 3 strings being unicode-by-default, the rich standard library, and the general high-level nature of the language, I don\\'t see much of a use case at all. Certainly, I don\\'t think it\\'s contentious to say the drawbacks of making it the default behavior outweigh the benefits, with any real use cases easily accommodated by more specific `str.characters` or `str.bytes` methods.\\n\\nSo, what gives? Has this issue ever been actively discussed in the development of the language? Is it just a case of a holdover from earlier languages that was never really a big enough deal to get challenged? And why was it made even more formal with the introduction of `collections.abc`? Google-ing hasn\\'t really provided any strong answers, so any stories or nuggets of info greatly appreciated!\\n\\n**edit:** Maybe should have made it more clear that the question is really why strings are *still* iterable by default. I understand the history of strings as character arrays, and don\\'t have a hard time imagining how that naturally made it into the language. But why that is still the case in Python 3 given that:\\n\\n* It is a gotcha new users frequently run into (just search for people asking how to properly handle a `str` vs a `[str]` in a function argument)\\n* It doesn\\'t *really* fit with how we think about the datatypes in Python (I doubt many Python programmers day-to-day think of a `str` as \"an ordered collection of `str` objects\")\\n* The uses for iterable-by-default seem limited given the wide builtin and standard library functionality available for `str` objects.',\n",

AI's added abilities have successfully reduced manual labor to a great extent and almost perfected the accuracy level.\\xa0\\n\\nThe amount of data produced increases its volume day by day, and the size has now become impossible to handle manually. AI helps analyze the data of many organizations to predict their future outcome and plan growth strategies accordingly. For example, many online websites have now launched the feature of chatbots that utilizes AI. This helps to enhance the customer experience. This shows how AI and machine learning efficiently and accurately process huge volumes of data for drawing in more customers.\\n\\nForming Future Technologies\\n\\nThe rising volume of data is increasing the complexity of data proportionately. As data becomes more complex, analyzing it manually becomes tougher. This machine intelligence is utilized to analyze and process the data for accurate results, and there is no limit to data.\\xa0\\n\\nUsing artificial intelligence mainly enhances three aspects of any organization. They are:\\n\\n* Accuracy in predictions and insight production increases business efficiency.\\n* It is a very low-cost venture instead of hiring many individuals at high salaries.\\n* Finally, it increases the productivity of the organization.\\n\\nThis gives a precise reason why many companies use AI and machine learning to propel product development and improve the overall performance. Research has also discovered that using AI-laded technologies is the new trend in industrial transformation, particularly for enhancing the company. It has also concluded that within a few years, the companies that utilized AI in producing innovative products and processes are most likely to expand their grounds. To sum up, AI and machine learning produce better results while giving much smaller efforts.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Use of Python\\n\\n[Python](https://www.python.org/) checks off many boxes that result in being useful for AI and machine learning. Many features are present in Python, which makes it one of the best languages for these purposes. Thus, the knowledge of Python is important in the data science field as many industries use it to predict and analyze data. Python is open-source in nature, so AI development companies' achievements can be shared with the community.\\xa0\\n\\nSome industries that extensively use Python in expanding their businesses are:\\n\\n* Healthcare\\n* Travel and transportation\\n* Finance technology\\n\\nHealth Care\\n\\nHealth centers use data to scrutinize and diagnose their patients properly.

Therefore, implementing AI in the travel industry helps with customer efficiency, creating cost-effective budget plans, and setting the price details of new routes.\\xa0\\n\\nFinance Technology\\n\\nAI has also used its way in finance sectors to save from risks and frauds.

       " 'Recently I started  a weekly algorithm project just to help me study new algorithms with a flair of good practice. This week I decided to focus on Python and the \"Middle Square Method\" a PRNG produced by John von Neuman in 1949. I further reiterated two attempted improvements to the algorithm that come from a couple of papers just last month: one using a Weyl Sequence and another using the Weyl Sequence with a Counter - both were by Bernard Widynski.   \\n\\n\\nTesting them was interesting as there appeared to be barely a difference between the two new iterations, however, both were much more stable than the original work by von Neuman. Typically with the newer algorithms I\\'d gather a standard deviation roaming around 4-8 x 10\\\\^15-18. Obviously that\\'s fairly in line with modern standards. The original method had a lower deviation, however, I found that one harder to test perhaps because I should have a used a different algorithm.  \\n\\n\\nFull documentation can be found here if anyone is interested.

My github link includes my buildozer spec file and a text file of my firebase rules.\\n\\nThe premise of my game is simple: you're shown a target number, and you need to use the on-screen buttons to input the prime factors of that number, in order of smallest to largest (e.g. for target number 66, the prime factors are 2, 3, and 11, so you would press '2 3 1 1'. You are timed, and each time you complete a target, you get a new one. Target numbers get larger with time so that there is some difficulty progression.\\n\\nMost of the functionality is shown in the linked video above, but some notable things are that you can create an online profile or play fully offline, the game shows you a variety of stats and graphs of your past play data, there are search functions to find points shown on the graphs, there is an online scoreboard, with a graph showing the leaderboard entries overlapped. You can also view the stats and graphs of other online players.\\n\\nThere are two glitches that I ran into with Kivy:\\n\\n* kivy-garden scatterplot graphs sometimes have a graphical issue where the data points disappear and are not redrawn. The workaround was to redraw the graph with a slightly different size (I added a numpy random number times a negligibly small number to the size I actually needed).\\n* in the kivy textboxes, if the user types an '@' sign while the font size is large, it can crash the app. Definitely one of the most bizarre glitches I've ever encountered, but I just kept the font size small to avoid it.\\n\\nI tried to add sounds for button feedback, but there was too much of a delay and it wasn't very good, so I've taken it out and plan to add sounds sometime in the future with another method to avoid the delay.\",\n",

Well, data classes can be artificial constructs. Especially \"space spectra\" (asteroid, mass spectra of dust particles in space, or spectra of so-called active galactic nuclei), are not always 100% distinguishable and have transitional classes between major classes.\\n\\nSo... can we classify our asteroid spectra in a data-driven way?

I recently release RecoverPy v1.5.0 and I think I might give you some news.\\n\\n**-&gt; Repo:** [https://github.com/PabloLec/RecoverPy](https://github.com/PabloLec/RecoverPy)  \\n\\n\\n# What is it?\\n\\nRecoverPy is a 100% Python tool to not only recover deleted but also overwritten files.  \\nI got the idea when I was quite new to some programming best practices, especially version control...  \\n\\n\\nLong story short, I accidentally piped my output into my precious script... Just spent the day working on something and instead of typing myscript &gt; log, I typed log &gt; myscript, oh boy what a feeling.\\n\\nI knew some tools to recover deleted files, but my problem was quite different, I didn't deleted the file (in system words, marked the file blocks as deleted/available), I just replaced it's content. Talk about an impostor syndrome.\\n\\nAfter a long ride in the abysses of unix stackexchange, I found some dark combination of grep and dd command to search directly in your raw system partitions blocks and eventually recovered my file! But as the process was really slow and painful, I thought it might be a good idea to make a tool out of it. That's how RecoverPy was born.  \\n\\n\\n# 1.5.0\\n\\nSince then, the tool has had quite some success. Especially in the hacker community (wasn't the initial intent but still). It even appeared in hakin9 magazine.\\n\\nLast releases have been quite stable, lastly I mostly added QoL updates and better binary file search handling.\\n\\nFeel free to have a look and tell me what you think of it! It's my biggest personal project and I'm beginning to be quite proud of my baby :)\",\n",

This is really bad for efficiency since everything added and modified in the Qt Designer need to be saved and translated again and manually copied from the new py file to the main py file, and all objects’ code’s locations need to be manually located (Unlike in windowbuider where you double click the object in the builder and you will be automatically redirected to the related code) \\nSince Python is such a popular language and so many people use it to develop complicated GUI softwares, I guess there has to be a GUI builder that is more efficient and similar to Java’s windowbuilder',\n",

       " 'From a search, it looks like this question comes up every couple of months and, like everything else in IT, the answer is \"It depends.\" So, here are my depends...\\n\\nTL;DR - My shop is running database servers on Windows with maintenance and health check scripts written in DOS .BAT files. The company plans to migrate to cloud servers running Linux using the same database software (DB2 LUW). I want to update our scripts to a new scripting language prior to migrating and port to the new platforms when the time comes. In terms of porting between platforms, and getting a team of DBAs used to a new scripting language, would you go with Python or Powershell? Python seems easier to learn and implement, but I think PS might port better. Your thoughts?\\n\\n---\\n\\nMy shop is running database servers on Windows (not SQL Server) with the intent to migrate to cloud servers running Linux at some point in the future yet to be determined. Our database maintenance scripts are DOS .BAT files. That alone is reason enough to rewrite in a better language and, while we\\'re at, we\\'ll build in intelligence, restartability, health checks, logging. Not a lot of activity from the scripts themselves as they mostly run utilities and not many will run in a day or at once.\\n\\nMy plan is to convert the DOS .BAT files to PS now and port to Linux when/if we migrate.  However, I\\'m seeing a lot about Python and looked over some code. The pros I see for it is it seems easy to pick up and not too fussy. I also see comments on its speed and low resource consumption. Those same comments also note that speed and resources aren\\'t an issue as long as concurrency is low, as it is in my case.\\n\\nHow is Python in porting between OSes? In Powershell, you have to code path names using the .net objects in order to get OS-independent code. Is there a similar mechanism in Python or will things like drive names and path separator characters cause issues?\\n\\nAnother example in PS is \\'sort\\'.  If you use the \\'sort\\' command, it will invoke the command for that OS which may behave differently. To get OS-independence, you have to use the actual Powershell command Sort-Object.\\n\\nAre there similar work-arounds in Python for path names? Does Python have issues with system commands that are named the same in both OSes? Are there any other porting gotchas?\\n\\nEDIT to answer common questions: The DB software is DB2 from IBM. There\\'s a mainframe version, which we run on z/OS, and an LUW version, where LUW stands for Linux/Unix/Windows. Although it runs on Windows, industry standard for DB2 LUW is to run on Linux or AIX. We\\'re currently running DB2 LUW on Windows Servers. Job scheduling is handled on the mainframe with remote triggers to the servers to run the scripts. The scripts are running utilities like reorgs, backups, restoring backups to other servers and then sending completion or failed status back to the mainframe scheduler.',\n",

       " \"So, recently I had to deal with the issue of setting up a solution to monitor a few on-prem deployments for health status. The on-prem clusters were configured to send emails with multiple tables with the status of every node etc.\\n\\nWell, it is a pretty straightforward solution was writing a python script to check the mailbox for new mail and download recent mail from the cluster, parse the mail and for each table entry verify for failed nodes and create an alert ticket of each node. I stumbled upon a [Github Project](https://github.com/wichmannpas/simple-mail-monitoring) that does something like this.\\n\\nConsidering the job was pretty much done, I was able to quickly use that script to do basic email retrieval and write parsers for my mail and get the job done in a few hours.\\n\\nHowever,  the code felt very complicated and it was pretty much thrown away, but after giving it a few hours of solace at home, it occurred to me,  this kind of problem could be better tackled with queues or pubsub model and it has been a while I have played around with python.  I wanted to avoid the hassle of setting up Redis/rabbitmq etc, I was rather looking for something like redux for python applications, which I can use to separate out my data producers and consumers.\\n\\nI had a few things in my mind for this side project :\\n\\n\\\\- In memory pubsub\\n\\n\\\\- Use asyncio\\n\\n\\\\- Be able to schedule events without cron tasks\\n\\n\\\\- Unobtrusive pattern to design my python code into producer and consumer model\\n\\n\\\\-  Ability to develop pull-based data sync, which can connect to your real time data feed\\n\\nHere is the basic hello world program which demonstrates how you can create a publisher function and schedule it with run\\\\_every to execute every 180 seconds after the last execution.\\n\\n[aioredux hello world](https://preview.redd.it/6vb91s6accr81.png?width=3164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6de8ffdbda5fad9eb22404325887e8873a105c60)\\n\\nHere is the link to my [fork](https://github.com/aregee/simple-mail-monitoring) of the Simple Mail Monitoring Github project, which utilizes this pattern to run the existing functionality provided by the original source.\\n\\nI can't share my private repo, but I must say after moving that hackish script to this slightly better hack has made the code so clean and flexible, we have not just accomplished that email report task, but rather we are able to see many more such use cases internally where we can utilize this pattern.\\n\\nPlease feel free to share your thoughts, feedback, or even pull requests on the project.\",\n",

If you need to call the Terraform command in the Python program for deployment, a new process needs to be created to execute the Terraform command on the system.

Doing so has the following problems:\\n\\n* Requires Terraform commands on the system.\\n* The overhead of starting a new process is relatively high.\\n\\nThis library compiles Terraform as a **dynamic link library** in advance, and then loads it for calling. So there is no need to install Terraform, nor to start a new process.\\n\\nIn addition, since the Terraform dynamic link library is loaded, this library can further call Terraform's **internal capabilities**, such as parsing Terraform config files.\\n\\nFeel free to use it and look forward to your feedback!\",\n",

The goal is to provide a way to cipher plain text files based on a key and then automatically find the key back to decipher the text.\\n\\nSome trade-offs were made for simplicity: only the basic 26 letters alphabet was allowed and any spaces or punctuation was removed as well.\\n\\nIn that sense, it\\'s a good introduction to implement ciphering but not a real-world tool! \\n\\nMore information about what a cipher is and how they\\'re implemented can be found in the README and in the documentation of the code. \\n\\nWe can start with the most simple example, a *Caesar* cipher which is a one letter shift. \\n\\nFor example, the sentence `Hello World!`, shifted by the letter `K` (\"a\" is 0 and \"k\" is 10), will become : \\n\\n    | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |  plain text\\n    | K | K | K | K | K |  | K | K | K | K | K |   key \\n    | R | O | V | V | Y |  | G | Y | B | V | N |  ciphered text\\n\\nThis kind of cipher is very susceptible to be cracked because the letters are all shifted by the same key (a unique letter). Since that\\'s the case, one can try to count the frequencies of each letter, plug back in the usual letter frequencies for each letter and it\\'s done. \\n\\nA Vigenère cipher is more elaborate, the key is a word or a sentence and not one letter. Because of this, the same letters can be shifted by a different amount and the resulting ciphered text is not susceptible to the deciphering explained above. \\n\\nFor example, The sentence `Hello World!`, encrypted with the word `key` (with letters indexed from 0 to 25), becomes: \\n\\n    | H | E | L | L | O |  | W | O | R | L | D |  plain text\\n    | K | E | Y | K | E |  | Y | K | E | Y | K |   key \\n    | R | I | J | V | S |  | U | Y | V | J | N |  ciphered text\\n\\nYou\\'ll find that where the key from this cipher matches the key from the previous one, the ciphered text matches! This is one of the basic building blocks used to attack this ciphering scheme, it\\'s a bit more elaborate but you can find the references and examples in the documentation of the code.\\n\\nI hope it\\'s clear =)',\n",

Most of my projects use Poetry as the build backend but I never even once interact with the Poetry CLI throughout the lifetime of the project.\\n\\nThe most notable differences to Poetry are\\n\\n* Slap supports mono-repositories (i.e. multiple related Python projects in the same repository), to the extent that it bumps version numbers of project inter-dependencies and installs your projects in topological order\\n* Slap supports development installs independent of the build backend (yes; this means you can install Poetry packages in editable mode even though the Poetry backend right now does not support editable installs)\\n* Slap's version bump command (`slap release`) updates the version not just in your `pyproject.toml` but also the `__version__` in your source code  as well as in related projects (see mono-repositories above) and any additional references you can configure via Regex patterns\\n* Slap does not automagically create a virtual environment for you when installing your project(s); instead, it errors when you try to install into a non-virtual Python environment and gives you an easy-to-use tool to create and activate virtual environments (and allowing multiple environments per project as well as global environments)\\n* Slap uses Pip to install your project(s), unlike Poetry which comes with its own dependency resolver and package installer (which I have been having a lot of issues with in the past).\\n* Slap does not have a concept of lock files\\n\\n**Ideas / Suggestions / Contributions**\\n\\nSlap is currently very opinionated by the fact alone that I built it as my personal workflow tool, but I welcome suggestions and contributions, and I am hopeful it will be useful to a wider audience than myself.\\n\\n**Links**\\n\\n* Documentation: [https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/slap/](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/slap/)\\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/slap](https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/slap)\\n* PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/slap-cli/](https://pypi.org/project/slap-cli/)\\n\\n**Edit**: I've added an in-depth [Getting started](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/slap/getting-started/) guide to the documentation.\",\n",

A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression. Here is its syntax:\\n\\n**lambda arguments : expression**\\n\\nThe expression is executed and the result is returned.\\n\\n## Example:\\n\\nAdd 10 to argument a, and return the result:\\n\\n    x = lambda a : a + 10\\n    print(x(5))\\n\\nThe result would be 15. (You could try this in a python IDE such as vs code)\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nLambda functions can take any number of arguments:\\n\\n## Example:\\n\\nMultiply argument a with argument b and return the result:\\n\\n    x = lambda a, b : a * b\\n    print(x(5, 6))\\n\\nThe result would be 30.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\n**Why Use Lambda Functions?**\\n\\nThe power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function. Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied by an unknown number:\\n\\n    def myfunc(n):\\n      return lambda a : a * n\\n\\nUse that function definition to make a function that always doubles the number you send in:\\n\\n## Example:\\n\\n    def myfunc(n):\\n      return lambda a : a * n\\n    \\n    mydoubler = myfunc(2)\\n    print(mydoubler(11))\\n\\nThe result would be 22.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nUse lambda functions when an anonymous function is required for a short period of time.\\n\\nIf you would like to watch the video version of this tutorial, you could click on the following link:\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGUl5Uwz3g8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGUl5Uwz3g8)\\n\\n**#python** **#pythonlambda** **#lambdafunction**\",\n",

If yes, it tweets a blank Wordle grid. If it isn't, then it searches for the replies to its newest tweet, and checks to see if it has a guess in it. This can either be a reply with just a five letter word, or a five letter \\\\[guess\\\\] contained in square brackets. It adds this to a replies.csv. Then, it sorts the guesses by the likes, and uses the most liked valid reply as the guess. It then plugs the guess into a Wordle function, which just runs an algorithm for detecting what coloured square goes where, and adding it to a list. The list then gets joined and pushed out with other Wordle things for the Twitter bot to tweet.

       " 'Hi Folks.\\n\\nI recently put some effort into creating a command line interface (CLI) made with Python.\\n\\nBackground: I started a new project called Gefyra, a tool for local application development directly with Kubernetes. Check it out the website [https://gefyra.dev](https://gefyra.dev) or have a glance at the code [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/tree/main/client](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/tree/main/client)\\n\\nI\\'d like to have an executable with (almost) the startup performance of `kubectl` (the executable to control a Kubernetes cluster). That means, I need fast startup times (which is crucial for a CLI) and ideally just one file (which is statically-linked) for easy distribution. In addition, I’d like to provide executables for Windows, MacOS and Linux. For those requirements people would usually go for Go (needless to say it\\'s awesome), however I started out with a prototype written in Python and it evolved over time. So I tried to find a way to make this work with Python.\\n\\nI went the following way:\\n\\n1. PyInstaller: [https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\\n2. Nuitka: [https://nuitka.net/](https://nuitka.net/)\\n3. PyOxidizer: [https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\\n\\n**PyInstaller**\\n\\nPyInstaller was quite easy to set up. However, the resulting executable was complained about by Virustotal (see: [https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)) because of PyInstaller\\'s bootloader. Somehow the code signature was also found in viruses (lol). To workaround this I compiled a bootloader myself which at least removed the virus issues. \\n\\nOn MacOS I faced startup times of more than 10 s with internet connection and about 3 s without internet connection. Interestingly, the former docker-compose command was also created from PyInstaller and Mac users complained about the startup performance, too: [https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6956](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/6956) :)\\n\\nI didn’t find much to improve. The concept of PyInstaller will potentially always be a problem for fast startup times (which IMHO makes it unsuitable for CLI applications).\\n\\n**Nuitka**\\n\\nWith Nuitka, I generated very large binaries of about 150 Mb. The startup performance was already much better than PyInstaller for Mac and Linux. However, I was not completely satisfied and very long compile times bothered me a little bit (about 10 min).\\n\\n**PyOxidizer**\\n\\nI ended up using PyOxidizer. This well-crafted toolkit compiles Python to Rust code and also includes all dependencies into one handy binary executable. With no special optimizations I saw startup times of about 700 ms. That is almost acceptable, though I wanted to go a little further.\\n\\nI started to examine the output of `python -X importtime -m gefyra 2&gt; import.log` just to check the imports. There is an awesome tool to analyze the Python imports: tuna (see: [https://github.com/nschloe/tuna](https://github.com/nschloe/tuna)). `tuna` allows analyzing the import times from the log. Run it like so `tuna import.log`. It opens a browser window and visualizes the import times. With that I was able to manually move all imports to the functions in which they are needed (and bring in some other optimizations). This greatly violates PEP 8 ([https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports)) but leads to very fast startup times.\\n\\nThese are the startup values I finally reached with `gefyra` under average modern Ubuntu:\\n\\n    &gt; python -m timeit \"__import__(\\'os\\').system(gefyra)\"  \\n    10 loops, best of 5: 33.5 msec per loop  \\n\\nPretty neat, isn’t it?   \\nIn comparison the `kubectl` executable:\\n\\n    &gt; python -m timeit \"__import__(\\'os\\').system(\\'kubectl\\')\"  \\n    10 loops, best of 5: 24.9 msec per loop  \\n\\nIn addition, I created GitHub actions to run the PyOxidizer builds once a new version is released (see: [https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/blob/main/.github/workflows/dist-build-linux.yaml](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra/blob/main/.github/workflows/dist-build-linux.yaml)). Only Windows is missing at the moment.\\n\\nAlthough, PyInstaller and Nuitka did not deliver the best startup times, I would not say it\\'s bad software. They probably shine at other aspects.\\n\\nI hope these insights can be useful for someone else, too.',\n",

       " 'Hi all,\\n\\nI have made a couple of posts about Red Mail in the past but I recently received some comments feeling this being underrated compared to how useful it really is. So, I hope you don\\'t mind an update,  I also just released a new version.\\n\\nSo what is Red Mail? It\\'s an email library that aims for simplicity without compromising features. You will find a bunch of email senders from Pypi but there is nothing quite like this.\\n\\nSo what can it do?\\n\\n* [Supports sending HTML, text, attachments](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/sending.html)\\n* [Send to regular receivers, cc (carbon copy) or bcc (blind carbon copy)](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/sending.html)\\n* [Attachments from various types: paths, bytes, Pandas dataframes, etc.](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/attachments.html)\\n* [Emails with embedded images in HTML](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedding-content)\\n* [Embedded images from various types: Matplotlib plots or PIL images](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedding-content)\\n* [Emails with embedded (prettified) tables from Pandas dataframes](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/body_content.html#embedded-tables)\\n* [Templated emails using Jinja](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/jinja_support.html)\\n* [Gmail and Outlook pre-configured](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/config.html)\\n* [Logging handlers!](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/logging.html)\\n* [Flask integration](https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)\\n\\nA minimal example for Gmail users:\\n\\n    from redmail import gmail\\n    \\n    gmail.username = \"example@gmail.com\"\\n    gmail.password = \"&lt;MY PASSWORD&gt;\"\\n    \\n    gmail.send(\\n        sender=\"example@gmail.com\",\\n        receivers=[\"you@example.com\"],\\n        subject=\"An example email\",\\n        html=\"\"\"\\n            &lt;h1&gt;Hi,&lt;/h1&gt;\\n            &lt;p&gt;nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n        \"\"\",\\n    )\\n\\nMore advanced features:\\n\\n    from redmail import EmailSender\\n    \\n    email = EmailSender(host=\"smtp.myhost.com\", port=0)\\n    \\n    email.send(\\n        sender=\"me@example.com\",\\n        receivers=[\"you@example.com\"],\\n        subject=\"An example email\",\\n        html=\"\"\"\\n            &lt;h1&gt;Hi {{ friend }},&lt;/h1&gt; \\n            &lt;p&gt;look at this image:&lt;/p&gt;\\n            {{ nice_image }}\\n        \"\"\",\\n        body_params={\"friend\": \"Jack\"},\\n        body_images={\"nice_image\": \\'path/to/image.png\\'},\\n        attachments={\"file.csv\": pd.DataFrame({\"col\": [1, 2, 3]})}\\n    )\\n\\nSo it\\'s pretty clean and does everything you wished from an email sender. There are alternatives for email sending but nothing quite like this. It is also well tested and documented.\\n\\nResources:\\n\\n* Source code: [https://github.com/Miksus/red-mail](https://github.com/Miksus/red-mail)\\n* Documentation: [https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://red-mail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\n* Releases: [https://pypi.org/project/redmail/](https://pypi.org/project/redmail/)\\n\\nIf you need to integrate it to a Flask application:\\n\\n* Source code: [https://github.com/Miksus/flask-redmail](https://github.com/Miksus/flask-redmail)\\n* Documentation: [https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://flask-redmail.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\\n* Releases: [https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Redmail/](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Redmail/)\\n\\nSo what has changed? Now the email structures are more structured and more likely gets rendered across email providers, fixed a bug related to embedded emails and aliases and improved documentation.\\n\\nIf you found it useful, leave it a star on Github. That\\'s the way to get visibility and it lets me know I\\'m building useful things in my free time. Thanks again for all the support!',\n",

This [Simple Desktop Clock](https://github.com/underpig1/simplest-desktop-clock) uses python's tkinter to create a desktop clock for cleaner layouts.

I created this program a few weeks back because I was annoyed with the tiny clock in the bottom right of my screen and wanted something like the big clock on the lock screen.

       " '## Use this logging template in your next big project\\n\\nFinding bugs is a common problem in any programming project. To make it easier to find bugs, you probably want to write some print statements to help you debug.\\n\\nIs it helpful? yes. Is it the right way to track events in your code, especially in a big project? no.\\n\\nPython has a built-in logging module that you can use to log messages. Logging not only helps you debug the issues in your code. It also helps you understand the flow of your code especially when you ship to production.\\n\\nIt is a very useful tool to identify how your code is behaving whether it is working as expected or not. If not, it can show you different hierarchies of how severe the issue is whether it is an error, a warning, or a debug mode.\\n\\nWithout having logging, it\\'s difficult to keep your code maintainable for a long time. Especially when this code is mature.\\n\\nIn this tutorial, I\\'ll show you a boilerplate for logging that you can use in your next project. Instead of looking at the documentation every time.\\n\\n## Division Example\\nLet\\'s take this division example especially when we divide by zero:\\n```python\\ndef divide(dividend, divisor):\\n    try:\\n        return dividend / divisor\\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\\n        return \"Zero Division error.\"\\n\\nprint(divide(6, 0))\\n```\\nIn this case, when we divided 6 by 0 we returned a message string. This message shows that a zero division error during the `ZeroDivisionError` exception occurred.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the problem with that? The issue here is that we don\\'t know when that happened and how severe the issue is. Is it a warning? an error? or just a piece of information you\\'re printing to the console?\\n\\nThe built-in Python\\'s `logging` module helps you better log your code with its features. Let\\'s see how we can use it in this context:\\n```python\\nimport logging\\n\\n# Define a logger instance\\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n# Define a stream handler for the console output\\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\\n\\n# Customize the formatter on the console\\nformatter = logging.Formatter(\\n    \"%(asctime)s -  %(name)s: %(levelname)s - %(message)s\",\\n    datefmt=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\\n    )\\n# Add the formatter to the handler\\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\\n\\n# Add the stream handler to the logger that we will use\\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\\n# Set the level of logging to be INFO instead of the default WARNING\\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\\n\\ndef divide(dividend, divisor):\\n    try:\\n        logger.info(f\"Dividing {dividend} by {divisor}\")\\n        return dividend / divisor\\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\\n        logger.info(\"Zero Division error.\")\\n\\nprint(divide(6, 0))\\n```\\nwhich would return helpful information like this:\\n```\\n2022-02-23 13:24:41 -  __main__: INFO - Dividing 6 by 0\\n2022-02-23 13:24:41 -  __main__: INFO - Zero Division error.\\n```\\n## Wrap Up\\nIn this boilerplate, you\\'ve seen how to log messages to the console. You\\'ve formatted the logs to start with a date and time followed by the name of the module, level of logging, and the log message itself.\\n\\nCheck out the [logger module here](https://gist.github.com/EzzEddin/0e8c517a47e678da6a60cc21fdbc5788) and let me know if you have any feedback, thanks!',\n",
       " \"The clean division of data analysis labor between Python and SQL seems to be fading with tools like dbt, Snowpark and dask-sql. The article shared below compares the two languages in terms of performance, functionality and developer XP. \\n\\nQuick summary:\\n\\n**Performance**  \\nRunning SQL code on data warehouses is generally faster than Python for querying data and doing basic aggregations. This is because SQL queries move code to data instead of data to code. That said, parallel computing solutions like Dask and others that scale Python code to larger-than-memory datasets can significantly lower processing times compared to traditional libraries like pandas.\\n\\n**Functionality**  \\nSQL’s greatest strength is also its weakness: simplicity. For example, writing SQL code to perform iterative exploratory data analysis, data science or machine learning tasks can quickly get lengthy and hard to read. Python lets you write free-form experimental data analysis code and complex mathematical and/or ML code. The absence of a vibrant and reliable third-party library community for SQL is also a problem compared to Python.\\n\\n**Developer XP**  \\nPython makes debugging and unit-testing a lot easier and more reliable. While dbt has added code versioning by forcing the use of Git, SQL diffs are still harder to read and manipulate than diffs in Python IMO.\\n\\n**Conclusion**  \\nWhile it's tempting to frame the debate between SQL and Python as a stand-off, the two languages in fact excel at different parts of the data-processing pipeline. One potential rule of thumb to take from this is to **use SQL for simple queries that need to run fast** on a data warehouse, **dbt for organizing more complex SQL models**, and **Python with distributed computing libraries like Dask for free-form exploratory analysis and machine learning code** and/or code that needs to be reliably unit tested.\\xa0  \\n\\n\\nFull article:  \\n[https://airbyte.com/blog/sql-vs-python-data-analysis](https://airbyte.com/blog/sql-vs-python-data-analysis)\",\n",
