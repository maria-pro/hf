Here's a Python code example that uses a pre-trained language model (LLM) from Hugging Face Transformers to analyze text data, such as political speeches or social media posts, to extract themes and sentiments. The code leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library and the `datasets` library to streamline the process.

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
!pip install transformers datasets torch
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset
For demonstration purposes, let's assume you have a dataset of text data. If you don't have a dataset ready, you can use the `datasets` library to load one.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a sample dataset (you can replace this with your own dataset)
dataset = load_dataset('ag_news', split='train[:1000]')  # Using a subset for demonstration
```

### Step 3: Load the Pre-trained Model and Tokenizer
We'll use a pre-trained transformer model for sentiment analysis and theme extraction. For sentiment analysis, you can use a model fine-tuned on a sentiment classification task. For theme extraction, we'll use a zero-shot classification approach.

```python
from transformers import pipeline, AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

# Load sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment')
sentiment_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment')
sentiment_analyzer = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model=sentiment_model, tokenizer=sentiment_tokenizer)

# Load zero-shot classification pipeline for theme extraction
zero_shot_classifier = pipeline('zero-shot-classification', model='facebook/bart-large-mnli')
```

### Step 4: Define the Categories for Theme Extraction
Define the potential themes you want to extract from the text data.

```python
themes = ["economy", "health", "education", "foreign policy", "environment", "technology", "social justice"]
```

### Step 5: Analyze the Text Data
Let's process the text data to extract sentiments and themes.

```python
def analyze_text(text):
    # Sentiment analysis
    sentiment = sentiment_analyzer(text)[0]

    # Theme extraction using zero-shot classification
    theme = zero_shot_classifier(text, candidate_labels=themes, multi_label=False)

    return {
        'text': text,
        'sentiment': sentiment['label'],
        'sentiment_score': sentiment['score'],
        'theme': theme['labels'][0],
        'theme_score': theme['scores'][0]
    }

# Apply analysis to the dataset
results = [analyze_text(item['text']) for item in dataset]
```

### Step 6: Display the Results
You can display or save the results in a DataFrame for further analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd

df_results = pd.DataFrame(results)
print(df_results.head())

# Save the results to a CSV file
df_results.to_csv('text_analysis_results.csv', index=False)
```

### Summary of the Code
- **Sentiment Analysis:** The code uses a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis.
- **Theme Extraction:** The code uses a zero-shot classification approach with the BART model to classify the text into predefined themes.
- **Data Handling:** The code processes a dataset of text data and applies both sentiment and theme extraction.

This script can be easily adapted to different datasets, themes, or models by modifying the dataset loading part or the themes list. For larger datasets or more complex analysis, consider running this on a more powerful machine or using Google Colab with a GPU runtime.
